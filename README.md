## Introduction

This pipeline processes RNA-seq data, aligning reads to a reference genome and performing quantification, quality control, and differential expression analysis. The pipeline is fully customizable, allowing users to adjust the parameters to suit their experimental design.

## Requirements

- **Nextflow** >= 21.04.0
- **Docker** or **Singularity** for containerized execution
- **Java** >= 8
- Reference genome and GTF/GFF annotation file
- RNA-seq raw data in FASTQ format

The pipeline is compatible with different computing environments, including local machines, high-performance computing clusters (SLURM, PBS), and cloud infrastructures.

## Installation

To install Nextflow, follow these steps:

1. **Download and Install Nextflow**:
   ```bash
   curl -s https://get.nextflow.io | bash
   mv nextflow ~/bin/

2. **Install Docker (if using Docker for containerized execution)**:
   Follow the instructions on Docker installation.

3. **Install Singularity (if using Singularity containers)**:
   Follow the instructions on Singularity installation.

## Pipeline Overview

This RNA-seq analysis pipeline performs the following steps:

1. **Quality Control**:
   - Performs quality checks on the raw RNA-seq reads using tools like `FastQC`.
   - Provides visual summaries of the read quality and highlights potential issues such as adapter content, overrepresented sequences, and low base quality.

2. **Trimming**:
   - Removes adapter sequences and trims low-quality bases from the RNA-seq reads using tools like `Trim Galore` or `cutadapt`.
   - Ensures that only high-quality reads proceed to the alignment step.

3. **Read Alignment**:
   - Aligns the trimmed reads to the reference genome using `STAR` or `HISAT2`.
   - Generates aligned read files in BAM format, which are used for downstream analysis.

4. **Quantification**:
   - Quantifies gene expression levels using tools such as `featureCounts` or `Salmon`.
   - Produces a matrix of gene counts for each sample, which is used for downstream differential expression analysis.

5. **Differential Expression Analysis** (optional):
   - Compares gene expression levels between different experimental conditions using tools like `DESeq2` or `edgeR`.
   - Identifies genes that are significantly upregulated or downregulated between conditions.

6. **Visualization & Reporting**:
   - Generates visual reports for the quality control metrics using `MultiQC`, consolidating the results from FastQC and other tools.
   - Produces plots and tables summarizing the differential expression results, including heatmaps, volcano plots, and gene expression bar charts.
